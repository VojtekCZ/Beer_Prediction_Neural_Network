Prediction of non-alcoholic beers ratings based on chemical compositions using neural networks

This bachelor's thesis focuses on predicting the ratings of non-alcoholic beers based on their chemical composition using  neural network models. The goal is to analyze the relationship between the chemical composition of beers and consumer preferences, identify key factors influencing ratings, and interpret the chemical profile of the products. The results contribute to understanding the chemical factors affecting consumer preferences and can be used for production optimization.
